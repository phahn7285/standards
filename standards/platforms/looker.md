\# looker Standards



\## Standards

\- Looker MUST be used as a governed semantic and analytics layer where selected.

\- LookML MUST be the single source of truth for metrics and dimensions.

\- Business logic MUST NOT be duplicated outside LookML.

\- LookML models MUST be deterministic and version-controlled.

\- Explores MUST expose only approved, documented fields.

\- Dimensions and measures MUST have clear semantic meaning.

\- Naming conventions MUST be consistent, descriptive, and stable.

\- Derived tables MUST be intentional and performance-justified.

\- Persistent derived tables MUST define refresh triggers explicitly.

\- Access controls MUST follow least-privilege principles.

\- Sensitive data MUST be masked, restricted, or excluded appropriately.

\- Joins MUST be explicit and correct.

\- Fanout and cardinality risks MUST be understood and mitigated.

\- SQL generated by Looker MUST be reviewed for correctness and performance.

\- Data freshness expectations MUST be explicit.

\- Dashboards MUST reflect governed metrics only.

\- Manual calculations in dashboards MUST be avoided.

\- Changes to LookML MUST be review-gated.

\- Looker usage MUST align with agents/security.md, agents/data-ml.md, and agents/observability.md.



\## Scope

In scope:

\- LookML models, views, and explores

\- Metrics, dimensions, and business logic

\- Derived tables and caching strategies

\- Dashboards and governed analytics

\- Access control and data governance



Out of scope:

\- Upstream ETL and data ingestion logic

\- Infrastructure provisioning specifics

\- Non-analytics application logic



Assumptions:

\- Looker is used as the authoritative analytics layer.

\- Source data systems are governed and versioned.

\- Analytics consumers rely on Looker for decision-making.



\## Responsibilities

\- Analytics engineers:

&nbsp; - Design and maintain LookML models

&nbsp; - Ensure correctness, performance, and semantic clarity

&nbsp; - Document metrics and assumptions



\- Platform engineers:

&nbsp; - Manage Looker environments, connections, and permissions

&nbsp; - Ensure security, reliability, and upgrades



\- Reviewers:

&nbsp; - Validate LookML correctness and join behavior

&nbsp; - Reject ungoverned or duplicated business logic



\- Data consumers:

&nbsp; - Use governed explores and dashboards

&nbsp; - Report discrepancies or performance issues



\## Usage

\- Apply this file when:

&nbsp; - designing or modifying Looker models or dashboards

&nbsp; - introducing new metrics or data sources

\- This file MUST be composed with:

&nbsp; - agents/security.md

&nbsp; - agents/data-ml.md

&nbsp; - agents/observability.md

&nbsp; - agents/repo-hygiene.md when versioning LookML

\- Database standards MUST be composed with:

&nbsp; - databases/\* based on source systems



\## Structure

\- LookML projects MUST be version-controlled.

\- Models MUST define connection scope and explores.

\- Views MUST define dimensions and measures only.

\- Explores MUST define joins and exposure rules.

\- Dashboards MUST be organized by domain or audience.



\## File Decomposition

\- Models:

&nbsp; - MUST define connections, includes, and explores.

\- Views:

&nbsp; - MUST define dimensions, measures, and field metadata.

\- Explores:

&nbsp; - MUST define joins, relationships, and access.

\- Derived tables:

&nbsp; - MUST define SQL logic and refresh behavior.

\- Dashboards:

&nbsp; - MUST consume governed explores only.

\- Access configuration:

&nbsp; - MUST define role-based permissions.



\## Application Rules

\- Governance rules:

&nbsp; - All metrics MUST be defined in LookML.

\- Join rules:

&nbsp; - Join cardinality MUST be validated.

\- Performance rules:

&nbsp; - Expensive queries MUST be optimized or pre-aggregated.

\- Security rules:

&nbsp; - Restrict access to sensitive fields.

\- Change rules:

&nbsp; - LookML changes MUST be reviewed and tested.

\- Verification rules:

&nbsp; - Generated SQL MUST be validated.

&nbsp; - Dashboards MUST be validated after changes.

&nbsp; - Violations of these standards MUST be treated as defects.
